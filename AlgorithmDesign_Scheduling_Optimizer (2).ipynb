    "## The Hong Kong Bank of Commerce and Industry case study, the labor scheduling example (Table 8.4)\n",
    "## We have implemented a **brute-force approach**, but enhanced it with a **custom pruning strategy** developed by our team to dramatically reduce the number of loops and invalid evaluations.\n",
    "## While we acknowledge that more efficient or mathematically optimal methods exist, our goal was to:\n",
    "  ## Understand the logic from the ground up\n",
    "  ## Solve the problem using core Python structures thought in the class (loops, conditionals, dictionaries)\n",
    "  ## Develop practical and intelligent constraints to prune the search space efficiently\n",

    "## PROBLEM:\n",
    "    ##Hong Kong Bank of Commerce and Industry requires between 10 and 18 tellers depending on the time of day\n",
    "    ##The bank wants a schedule that will minimize total personnel costs\n",

    "    ##Bank employs 12 full-time tellers, many part-time workers\n",
    "    ##Part-time workers must put in exactly four hours per day, can start anytime between 9 am and 1 pm, and are inexpensive\n",
    "    ##Full-time workers work from 9 am to 5 pm and have 1 hour for lunch\n",
    "    ##Part-time hours are limited to a maximum of 50% of the day’s total requirements\n",
    "    ##Part-timers earn $8 per hour on average\n",
    "    ##Full-timers earn $100 per day on average\n",
